## Features

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- REST API for model inference
- Integration with cloud storage for data management
- Monitoring and logging capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Render Account](https://render.com/)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Docker (if using containerization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishisrv1245790/ML_ops
   cd ML_ops

# 2.Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

- DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
- API_KEY=your_api_key
- MODEL_PATH=path_to_your_model
- Modify any configuration files as necessary (e.g., config.yaml).
- Deployment on Render Cloud
- To deploy your MLOps project on Render Cloud, follow these steps:

# 1.Create a New Web Service:
- Go to your Render dashboard.
- Click on "New" and select "Web Service".

# 2.Connect Your Repository:
Choose the repository you cloned earlier.
Select the branch you want to deploy.

# 3.Configure the Service:
Set the environment to Python.
Specify the build command (if using Docker, specify the Dockerfile path):

    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set the start command:

- gunicorn app:app  

## Environment Variables:
- Add the environment variables you specified in the .env file.

## Deploy:
- Click "Create Web Service" to start the deployment process.
- Usage
- Once deployed, you can interact with your model via the REST API. Hereâ€™s an example of how to make a prediction:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-service-url/api/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data": [your_input_data]}'

## Monitoring and Logging
Render provides built-in monitoring and logging tools. You can access logs from the Render dashboard to troubleshoot any issues.

## Contributing
